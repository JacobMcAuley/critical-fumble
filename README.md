# critical-fumble
Automatically rolls from a critical sucess/critical fail when you roll that natural success/fail during an attack!



# Tables

Currently, there is no table for fumbles on spells. All fumbles share the same Critical-Fumble Fumble table. If anyone is interested in creating a relatively balanced table and would like to incorporate fumbles on spells, feel free to contact me through Discord found through the Feedback section below.
